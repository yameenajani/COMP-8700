# COMP 8700 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
### This repository contains the coursework for COMP 8700. The details about the folder structure and how to run the code are mentioned below

1. *Assignment 2* <br>
This contains the code for the problems in assignment 2. To run the code, set up a python virtual environment using the following commands (make sure you have `virtualenv` or any other virtual environment library setup on your system) - <br>
`virtualenv venv` (create virtual env) <br>
`source venv/bin/activate` (activate the virtual env - **NOTE**: This command to activate the virtual env is for macOS/Linux systems. For Windows try `.\venv\Scripts\activate`)
* *A2_Q1_Missionaries&Cannibals* contains the code for the Missionaries & Cannibals problem. There are 4 different algorithms used - DFS, BFS, Best First and, A*. To see the outputs, just run the corresponding python file. For instance, <br> `python dfs.py`
* *A2_Q5_8_Queens_HC* contains the code for the Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing algorithm (with and without sideways moves). The code runs over 1000 instances. To run - <br> `python Analysis.py`
